# Java Control Flow Challenge

The system should receive two parameters via the terminal, representing two integers. With these two numbers, you should determine the number of iterations and print the incremented numbers to the console. If the first parameter is greater than the second, you should throw a custom exception with the message: "The second parameter must be greater than the first."

This challenge was inspired by Gleyson Sampaio, an instructor at DIO (Digital Innovation One), for the Santander Bootcamp 2023.

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.
- A terminal or command prompt for running the program.
